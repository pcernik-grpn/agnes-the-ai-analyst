# SharePoint extraction: from zero to the first crawl

The one place that walks an operator end to end: enable the connector,
connect a tenant, run the first crawl, verify what happened, then turn on
the optional LLM stages. Every step below links the reference doc that owns
its details — this page is the ORDER and the checklist, not a second copy of
those details.

The pipeline this activates (all in-process, no external producer):

```
Graph delta crawl → convert to markdown → anonymize (per scope) → ingest
into collections → (optional) facts extraction into the knowledge graph
```

## 0. Prerequisites

- **A deployment that can run the extraction worker lane.** On a Terraform
  VM: `extraction_worker_enabled = true` (plus its multi-process
  prerequisites — Postgres app-state, Redis coordination; the module
  renders all of it). Details: [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) →
  *extraction lane*. On plain Compose: the `extraction-worker` profile.
- **The standard app image** — since 2026-09 it already carries the
  converter backends (`extraction` extra). Bare-metal pip installs need
  `pip install 'agnes[extraction]'`; a missing extra is refused up front
  with `409 extraction_dependencies_missing`, never a crawl that fails on
  every file.
- **An Entra app registration** for the tenant: certificate (default) or
  client secret, with admin consent granted. This is the one step Agnes
  cannot do for you.
- Nothing to prepare for the anonymization key: it provisions itself from
  the server vault on first use ([`anonymization.md`](anonymization.md) →
  *The key: nothing to configure*).

## 1. Enable the connector

One switch: `sharepoint.enabled: true` in `/admin/server-config` (or
`AGNES_SHAREPOINT_ENABLED=1`; the Terraform flag sets it for you). It gates
the wizard, every `/api/admin/sharepoint/*` route, crawling, webhooks and
ACL mirroring together — there are no other flags to find
([`feature-flags.md`](feature-flags.md), migration note).

## 2. Connect the tenant

`/admin/data-sources` → add SharePoint → the connect wizard: tenant id,
client id, certificate or client secret, then pick scopes (sites / document
libraries / folders). Per scope, two decisions that matter later:

- **anonymize** — this scope's documents are pseudonymized BEFORE anything
  is stored, fail-closed ([`anonymization.md`](anonymization.md)).
- **access mode** — mirrored ACLs vs. open ([`RBAC.md`](RBAC.md) and the
  permission-zone notes in [`architecture.md`](architecture.md)).

## 3. Sanity-check the anonymization on YOUR documents

Before any crawl: source card → **View configuration** → **Preview
redaction**. Paste a sample or upload one real file — the panel shows the
converted markdown and the redacted version side by side, with per-kind
counts. Nothing you preview is stored. If your corpus has vocabulary of its
own (codenames, partners), add `extraction.anonymization.custom_terms`
first and preview again.

## 4. First crawl — one folder, small limits

Source card → **Run extraction now** → the options row: start with a small
per-run time limit and default concurrency. The run appears live on the
card; the drawer shows counters (new / changed / unchanged / skipped with
reasons), per-stage token usage, and — on interruption — whether the state
is resumable (`timeout` and `throttled` resume from persisted state; the
next run picks up where this one stopped).

Verify: the scope's collection holds the documents, skips are explainable
(oversize, unconvertible, lock files), and for an anonymize-marked scope a
spot-check shows pseudonyms, not names.

## 5. Scale up

- `extraction.schedule` — the instance-wide recurring sweep (empty =
  manual only).
- `extraction.crawler.concurrency` (default 6) — files pipelined per delta
  page; the crawl backs off on tenant throttling by itself (AIMD) and
  reports it. Per-run override in the Run-now options. Editable in
  `/admin/server-config` → *Extraction* → *crawler*; this is the extraction
  worker's **memory lever** (every file in flight is a converter child
  process holding that document — six in flight has exceeded a 12 GiB
  container on large decks, two held it under 4 GiB), and the worker reads
  it at the start of each run, so a save applies to the next run with no
  restart.
- Webhooks for near-real-time updates: mint the secret
  (`POST …/webhook`), then `POST …/subscriptions/ensure` — Agnes owns the
  Graph subscription lifecycle including renewals
  ([`api-reference.md`](api-reference.md) → *Graph subscription
  lifecycle*). Requires a public HTTPS origin (`AGNES_BASE_URL`).

## 6. Optional LLM stages (each a cost switch, default off)

| Stage | Switch | What it buys | Cost order |
|---|---|---|---|
| LLM name detection | `extraction.anonymization.detector: "llm"` | recall on names regex can't pattern-match | ~$5 / 1 000 docs (Haiku) |
| Scan OCR | `extraction.scan_ocr.enabled` | text from image-only PDFs | ~$0.006 / page |
| Facts extraction | `extraction.facts.enabled` (+ `facts.enabled`) | knowledge-graph facts with verbatim evidence | ~$0.05 / doc (Haiku), measured live — see `config/instance.yaml.example`'s `facts` block |

All three can run against a self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint instead
of the Anthropic API — globally (`extraction.llm`) or per stage, e.g. the
NER detector local while facts stay hosted:
[`self-hosted-llm.md`](self-hosted-llm.md).

Facts extraction normally runs as the tail of a crawl (`corpus-extraction`),
so a document only gets a model call once it has been crawled and ingested
in the SAME run. To (re)build the graph over a corpus that is already
indexed — after turning `extraction.facts.enabled` on for the first time
over an existing connection, or after a prompt/ontology change — trigger it
on its own, with its own wall-clock budget
(`extraction.facts.run_timeout_s`, independent of the crawl's own
`extraction.timeout_s`): source card → **Extract facts now** (next to
**Run extraction now**; disabled, with the reason, while either switch is
off), `POST /api/admin/sharepoint/connections/{id}/facts-extract`, or
`agnes admin sharepoint facts-extract <connection_id>` (`--doc-id` narrows
it to one document, e.g. to test a prompt change cheaply; `--timeout-s`
overrides the budget for that one run). The pass is incremental — indexed
documents without up-to-date facts — so it is safe to repeat, and it runs
alongside a crawl; while one is queued or running the card's Run row says
so and the button is locked.

## Troubleshooting quick table

| Symptom | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `409 feature_disabled` on admin routes | connector off | step 1 |
| `409 extraction_dependencies_missing` | converter backends missing (bare install) | `pip install 'agnes[extraction]'` |
| run ends `interrupted / timeout` | hit its time ceiling | fine — rerun resumes; raise `timeout_s` |
| run ends `interrupted / throttled` | tenant 429 budget exhausted | rerun later; lower concurrency |
| documents in `anonymize_failed` | fail-closed drop | check key status + detector availability; preview the file (step 3) |
| run history says "needs a Postgres backend" | `extraction_runs` is PG-only | run state needs Postgres app-state; config/preview still work |
