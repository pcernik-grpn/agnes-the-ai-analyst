"""`agnes admin sharepoint` — admin/ops triggers for SharePoint connector
maintenance jobs.

Today this covers exactly one surface: the standalone fact-graph trigger.
The crawl / ACL-sync / subtree-sweep triggers stay admin-web-UI-only, an
established precedent (see CONTRIBUTING.md's "admin/scheduler maintenance
op" exemption class, `tests/test_documentation_api_triple_surface.py`) —
this one earns a CLI counterpart because an operator asking "how do we get
the fact graph populated with what we already have?" needs an answer that
does not require opening a browser (a support runbook, a script run against
a remote instance).

CLI counterpart to
``POST /api/admin/sharepoint/connections/{connection_id}/facts-extract``.
